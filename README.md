📍 Lesson 1: Introduction to SQL & Databases
What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for interacting with relational databases.

🔹 Why Learn SQL?
✔ Essential for backend development, data analysis, cybersecurity, and finance
✔ Used in Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, and banks
✔ One of the highest-demand IT skills

Types of Databases
1️⃣ Relational Databases (RDBMS) – Use SQL (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle)
2️⃣ NoSQL Databases – Store unstructured data (e.g., MongoDB, Firebase)

Feature	SQL (Relational)	NoSQL (Non-Relational)
Structure	Tables with rows & columns	Collections & Documents
Query Language	SQL	JSON, Key-Value pairs
Transactions	ACID-compliant	BASE Model
Examples	MySQL, PostgreSQL	MongoDB, Firebase
